# SHIRE_RPG

SHIRE_RPG is an online application that allows rpg players to create and save their playersheets for games like WoD: Vampire the Masquerade 5th edition.

### ðŸš€ Tired of never finding a way to quickly create and save your rpg sheets when playing online?  
SHIRE_RPG intends to solve it. Just create an account, create your sheet under our supported games and open it anywhere!  
Since it's web-based, you can find it [@HERE](https://bagginsbr.pythonanywhere.com/)

## ðŸ”§ Local host: 
First you'll need to place the contents of /project inside a python ready virtual machine.  
Then, run:
```bash
.venv/bin/activate
```
```bash
pip3 install Flask
```
```bash
pip3 install flask-session
```
If everything is installed, then run on app.py directory:
```bash
flask run
```
